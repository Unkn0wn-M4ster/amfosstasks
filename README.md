# AmFoss
I am Kartik T Nair, currently pursuing B.Tech in CSE at Amrita University. My hobbies range from gaming to exploring new technologies.

## 1 Why should we choose you?

Explaining why you should choose me is challenging since I'm not aware of others' capabilities. However, I assure you of my wholehearted dedication to everything I do.
But some of my qualitites which might be aligned to the club is ->
- Disciplined (If and when required I will put my heart and soul into my work)
- Good Communication Skills
- Totally a good sense of humor (Dont question it)
- consistent ( Even tho I wont be able to do things I would try my hardest)
- Motivated (Generally im motivated If I have a goal I shall finish)

## 2 What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?

Explaining why you should choose me is challenging since I'm not aware of others' capabilities. However, I assure you of my wholehearted dedication to everything I do. (P.S. I'll be able to vibe about LOTR.)
My primary goal is to get into the club, after which I would love to make wholehearted contributions. However, I am not in a position to specify how I can contribute at the moment.But One of my goals will Definetly be to be good enough to be selected to 

## 3 How will you contribute back to the club?

I am enthusiastic about contributing to the club with my wholehearted dedication. The concept of open-source software truly intrigues me; hence, I would love to get involved. (Linux has definitely reinforced this mindset for me.)

## 4 (Edit after finishing the recruitment tasks)

I genuinely enjoyed most of the tasks, even though some tested my patience and sanity. Nevertheless, we move forward. Overall, it was a good experience and a fun time, despite the challenges faced during tasks.

## Thoughts on the Process

So far, it has been smooth, except for the minor hiccup where I missed joining and had to request another link from the coordinators. Kudos on maintaining a good Discord server!
