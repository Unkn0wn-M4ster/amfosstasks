# 1) THE FIRST CHALLENGE
  Starting off THe first challenge was rather simple all You really needed to do was google what the first perfect number was Being 6 and then solve the d.e answer which came out to be 5 
  -----You would then jump to 06 directory and then cat out the Spell_05.txt and then you would check for that in the spellbook and note down the code

# 2)SECOND CHALLENGE
   In The Second One You were asked to google which was the first element used in semiconductors being germanium i struggle a bit on this once since google kept showing me that it was either selenium or silicon or even mercury at one point
   ------After getting the answer as germanium (32) u would jump directory into the 02 and cat out the spell_03.txt and check the spellbook again for it

# 3) THE THIRD CHALLENGE
  In the third challenge you were given a riddle and hint which said that it was a shapeshifting animal knowing some basics of harry potter the first two answers which i went to were an Amimagus and a Boggort I could find any specific spell for amimagus hence switched my attention to the boggart And got to know that to remove the spell of a boggart A riddkulus spell is used Hence then i first git checkout the defenceofthedarkarts(since it asked what does remus teach) and then went to the spellbook and found out the code for this one

# 4) THE FOURTH CHALLENGE
   The last one was a bit weird for me as it asked us to look into the logs which wasnt the hard part The hard part was figuring out where The number of horcruxes were 7 or 8 thinking whether voldemort himself was considered coming to my sense i put in x as 7 and y as 3 as Seven and Three have same number of alphabets after which i tried finding the spell which i couldnt find then  i looked at the description of the challenge and realised it occurs in a  graveyard and wondered if that was a branch and sure enough it was and after getting the code from there i just base64 decoded and went to the website and ran the last spell
